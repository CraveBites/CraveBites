      <h1>Ingredients:

1 package (12 ounces) refrigerated pie crusts, or homemade pie crust
1 cup diced ham
1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Swiss, or your preferred cheese)
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced bell peppers (optional)
4 large eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a mini muffin tin.

Roll out the pie crusts on a lightly floured surface and use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles slightly larger than the size of each muffin cup.

Gently press each circle into the muffin cups, ensuring the dough reaches the edges and forms a small crust.

In a bowl, combine the diced ham, shredded cheese, diced onion, and diced bell peppers (if using). Mix well to distribute the ingredients evenly.

Spoon the ham and cheese mixture into each mini crust, filling them about 2/3 full.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, black pepper, dried thyme, dried oregano, and dried parsley until well combined.

Pour the egg mixture over the ham and cheese filling in each mini quiche, filling them almost to the top.

Carefully transfer the muffin tin to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the quiches are set and lightly golden on top.

Remove the mini quiches from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes in the muffin tin.

Using a small knife or offset spatula, gently loosen the quiches from the muffin cups and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Once cooled, the mini ham and cheese quiches are ready to be served. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.

These mini quiches are perfect for brunches, parties, or as a grab-and-go snack. You can store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Enjoy!
