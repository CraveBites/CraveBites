        Ingredients:

2 cans (15 ounces each) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari (for a gluten-free option)
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste for desired spiciness)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.

Drain and rinse the chickpeas thoroughly. Pat them dry with a kitchen towel or paper towels to remove any excess moisture.

In a bowl, combine the olive oil, honey or maple syrup, soy sauce or tamari, chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Mix well to create a marinade.

Add the chickpeas to the marinade and toss until they are evenly coated.

Spread the coated chickpeas in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.

Roast the chickpeas in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they are crispy and golden brown. Stir the chickpeas halfway through the cooking time to ensure even browning.

Remove the roasted chickpeas from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. They will become crispier as they cool.

Once cooled, transfer the chickpeas to a serving bowl or airtight container. They can be enjoyed immediately or stored for later snacking.

Tips:

For a sweeter flavor, you can increase the amount of honey or maple syrup in the marinade.
Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper according to your desired level of spiciness. Add more for a hotter kick or reduce for a milder flavor.
Feel free to experiment with additional spices such as cumin, smoked paprika, or onion powder to customize the flavor profile.
Sweet and spicy roasted chickpeas make a satisfying and healthy snack option. Enjoy them as is or use them as a crunchy topping for salads or soups!
