      <h1>Ingredients:

2 medium zucchini
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup breadcrumbs (regular or panko)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 large eggs, beaten
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with cooking spray.

Slice the zucchini into thin rounds, approximately 1/4-inch thick. You can use a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer for even slices.

In a shallow bowl or dish, combine the grated Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to evenly distribute the ingredients.

Dip each zucchini slice into the beaten eggs, making sure both sides are coated.

Press each egg-coated zucchini slice into the Parmesan breadcrumb mixture, ensuring both sides are coated with the mixture. Gently press the breadcrumbs onto the zucchini to help them adhere.

Place the coated zucchini slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake the zucchini chips in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until they become golden brown and crispy. Flip the chips halfway through the baking time to ensure even browning.

Once the zucchini chips are crispy and golden, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet. This will help them become even crispier.

Serve the Parmesan zucchini chips as a snack or appetizer. They are best enjoyed fresh and warm.

Tips:

Make sure to slice the zucchini into even thickness to ensure they cook evenly.
You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences by adding herbs such as dried oregano, basil, or red pepper flakes to the Parmesan breadcrumb mixture.
For a variation, you can also use a mixture of grated Parmesan and shredded mozzarella cheese for a gooey, cheesy coating.
Enjoy your homemade Parmesan zucchini chips as a healthier alternative to potato chips!
