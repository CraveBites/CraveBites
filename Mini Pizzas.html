      <h1>Ingredients:
For the Pizza Dough:

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon instant yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup warm water
2 tablespoons olive oil
For the Pizza Toppings:

1 cup pizza sauce or marinara sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
Assorted toppings of your choice (e.g., sliced pepperoni, diced bell peppers, sliced olives, diced onions, sliced mushrooms, etc.)
Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Pizza Dough:
a. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt.
b. Make a well in the center and pour in the warm water and olive oil.
c. Stir the mixture with a spoon or your hands until a dough forms.
d. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
e. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Divide the risen dough into small portions, about the size of a golf ball, and roll each portion into a round ball.

On a lightly floured surface, flatten each dough ball with your hands or a rolling pin into mini pizza crusts, approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. Place the mini crusts on the prepared baking sheet.

Spread a spoonful of pizza sauce or marinara sauce onto each mini crust, leaving a small border around the edges.

Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, and then add your desired toppings. Be creative and customize each mini pizza to your preference.

Bake the mini pizzas in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.

Remove the mini pizzas from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.

Serve the mini pizzas as appetizers, snacks, or a fun party food option.

Tips:

You can make the dough in advance and store it in the refrigerator overnight. Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before rolling and baking.
Experiment with different toppings such as cooked sausage, ham, pineapple, cherry tomatoes, or different types of cheeses for variety.
Mini pizzas are perfect for parties, game nights, or a fun family dinner. Enjoy the delicious homemade flavors!
