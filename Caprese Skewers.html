      <h1>Ingredients:

20 cherry tomatoes
20 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini)
20 fresh basil leaves
Balsamic glaze for drizzling
Salt and pepper to taste
Wooden skewers or toothpicks
Instructions:

Prepare the Skewers:
a. Soak wooden skewers in water for about 30 minutes to prevent them from burning while grilling or broiling. Alternatively, you can use toothpicks if you prefer bite-sized skewers.

Assemble the Skewers:
a. Take a cherry tomato and slide it onto the skewer or toothpick.
b. Follow with a fresh basil leaf folded in half.
c. Add a mozzarella ball.
d. Repeat this pattern with another cherry tomato, basil leaf, and mozzarella ball.
e. Continue assembling the skewers until all the ingredients are used.

Season and Drizzle:
a. Place the assembled skewers on a serving platter or plate.
b. Season the skewers with a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste.
c. Drizzle balsamic glaze over the skewers, ensuring each skewer gets a light coating. You can also serve the glaze on the side for individual drizzling.

Serve:
a. Serve the Caprese skewers immediately or refrigerate them until ready to serve.
b. If refrigerated, take them out about 10-15 minutes before serving to allow them to come to room temperature and enhance the flavors.
c. Arrange the skewers on a platter or serving dish, and they are ready to be enjoyed!

Tip: You can also enhance the presentation by serving the skewers on a bed of fresh arugula or drizzling with extra virgin olive oil before adding the balsamic glaze.

Caprese skewers make a delightful and elegant appetizer or finger food for parties, gatherings, or any occasion. Enjoy!
