      <h1>Ingredients:

20 large white or cremini mushrooms
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Clean the mushrooms by gently wiping them with a damp paper towel. Remove the stems and set aside. Place the mushroom caps on the prepared baking sheet.

Finely chop the mushroom stems and set aside.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.

Add the chopped mushroom stems to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the mushrooms release their moisture and become tender.

In a bowl, combine the cooked mushroom stem mixture, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, melted butter, dried thyme, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly incorporated.

Spoon the filling mixture into the mushroom caps, pressing it gently to fill the cavities. Mound the filling slightly over the tops of the mushrooms.

Bake the stuffed mushrooms in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until the mushrooms are cooked through and the filling is golden brown on top.

Remove the stuffed mushrooms from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.

Serve the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer or side dish. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.

Tips:

You can customize the filling by adding ingredients like cooked bacon, diced bell peppers, or shredded cheese for extra flavor.
To make the stuffed mushrooms ahead of time, prepare the filling and stuff the mushroom caps, then cover and refrigerate until ready to bake. Increase the baking time slightly if baking from cold.
Stuffed mushrooms make a delicious and elegant appetizer for any occasion. Enjoy!</h1>
