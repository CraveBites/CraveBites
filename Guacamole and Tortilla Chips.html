        Ingredients for Guacamole:

3 ripe avocados
1 lime, juiced
1/2 red onion, finely diced
2 tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely diced (optional, for heat)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
Ingredients for Tortilla Chips:

10 corn tortillas
Vegetable oil for frying
Salt to taste
Instructions:

Guacamole Preparation:
a. Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits. Scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl.
b. Add the lime juice to the avocados and mash them using a fork or a potato masher until desired consistency is reached (smooth or chunky).
c. Add the diced red onion, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper (if using), minced garlic, ground cumin, salt, and pepper to the mashed avocados.
d. Gently fold all the ingredients together until well combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
e. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, ensuring it touches the surface of the guacamole to prevent browning. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

Tortilla Chips Preparation:
a. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
b. Stack the corn tortillas on a cutting board and cut them into triangles.
c. In a large skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking.
d. Fry the tortilla triangles in batches, turning them once, until they become crispy and golden brown. This usually takes about 1-2 minutes per side.
e. Transfer the fried chips to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Sprinkle with salt while they are still hot.
f. Once all the chips are fried, arrange them in a single layer on baking sheets and place them in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes to further crisp them up.

Serving:
a. Take the guacamole out of the refrigerator and give it a gentle stir.
b. Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl, garnish with additional chopped cilantro if desired.
c. Arrange the crispy tortilla chips on a platter or serve them in a basket alongside the guacamole.
d. Serve the guacamole and tortilla chips together as a delicious snack or appetizer.

Enjoy your homemade guacamole and tortilla chips!
